## Technical Analysis

### Observed Frequency Bands
    ```text
    - 2.420 GHz â€“ 2.480 GHz (Wi-Fi)
    - 1.563 GHz (GPS L1 band)

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- Repeating RF bursts approximately 250ms apart

- Unregistered drone ID (OpenDroneID failure)

- Nearby mesh node logs: Packet loss spike from 2% to 43%

## Mitigation actions
   # Step 1: Isolate affected access points
    $ sudo netctl disable wlan-node-6
    
    # Step 2: Trigger spectrum scan
    $ rfwatch --scan --duration 60s
    
    # Step 3: Notify authorities
